         Not too long ago I had an epiphany. 
          <br>
          I realized I was unhappy because I was going through the motions but I wasn't creating anything new. 
          <br>
          I worked in the wine industry, in many capacities such as marketing, education, and production. 
          <br>
          I was good at it. I am good
          at it.
          <br>
          Super awesome, as a matter of fact. 
          <br>
          <br>
          But I wanted more. I wanted to produce art, I wanted to use creativity, and I wanted to be inspired. 
          <br>
          I realized I needed to do so in HTML, CSS and JS - there was no other way. 
          <br>
          I spent hours upon hours studying,
          and with the mentorship of my brother, 
          the encouraging words from my husband, and my chihuahuas on my lap, here I am today.
